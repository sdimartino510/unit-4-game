# unit-4-game
Homework assignment #4: jQuery

*unit-4-game*, also known as **Crystal Collector**, is an exercise in jQuery. It is a game that uses the jQuery language to dynamically update the DOM as a user provides input.

The idea behind the game is to match a predetermined score without going over. There are four crystals, each of which is assigned a different value at the start of the game. As the user clicks on each crystal, their score is updated and is being compared to the predetermined target score.

The user either matches the score exactly and wins, or goes over and loses. In either case, the game resets by changing the target score and the value of each crystal. A win/loss counter is also updated.
